# osm-postgis-scripts

This script may be used for detecting roundabouts in OSM that are missing the "junction"="roundabout" tag.
You may have to change some table names in the script for it to work.
The database I used for testing the script was downloaded from Geofabrik and loaded to the Postgressql server using this script: https://github.com/baditaflorin/osm-postgis-scripts/blob/master/scope.sh
